# Contributing

The `dev` branch is the current development version and it's where all contributions should go. It's semver version should be suffixed with `-dev` until release. Also note that the development version may change at any time, so when pulling new changes, be prepared to migrate your implementation or contribution if there are breaking changes.

When contributing, make sure to append a description of the changes to the [changelog](./changelog.md) file.
